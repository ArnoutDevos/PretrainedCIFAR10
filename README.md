# :rocket: *Pretrained* CIFAR 10 model - 90% accuracy 

This is an example of loading and testing a *pretrained* model on CIFAR-10.

## Notebook
[This notebook](https://github.com/ArnoutDevos/PretrainedCIFAR10/blob/master/PretrainedCIFAR10.ipynb) takes 1 minute to run (on a 32GB GPU) to verify the test the accuracy of around 90% (89%) with a pretrained model.
